pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy


# Model Performance Comparison

This document compares the performance of four different machine learning models: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes. The comparison is based on evaluation metrics including ROC AUC scores, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 scores, and time taken for evaluation.

## Models Evaluated

- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes

## Evaluation Metrics

| Metric                       | Random Forest             | Gradient Boosting        | Logistic Regression      | Naive Bayes             |
|------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Time Taken for Evaluation** | 88.93 seconds            | 315.17 second            | 15.20 seconds            | 34.53 seconds            |

## Summary of Results

- **Naive Bayes**:
  - Best performance across all metrics, including time efficiency, ROC AUC scores, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores.
  
- **Gradient Boosting**:
  - Effective but slower and lower performance compared to Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression.
  
- **Random Forest**:
  - Similar performance to Gradient Boosting, with slightly lower scores across metrics.

## Conclusion

Based on the evaluation, **Naive Bayes** is recommended for its superior performance, efficiency, and excellent generalization across training and test data. For scenarios where interpretability is crucial, **Gradient boosting** is a good alternative.
